If you can suggest a better design - feel free to make any suggestions about how to make it better. If not, just slice this design into plain HTML pages and an CSS File.
store all images in the /images folder and store any CSS file(s) in the /CSS folder.

The site is called "North Shore Computer Services".
It needs to have a fully functional menu.
It will have 7 or 8 pages:

1. The home page (instead of BurnabyComputerRepair, it will say NorthShoreComputerServices which will point to the home page)
2. Our Services. I have not decided yet if i should have 2 sub-pages under Services, one "For Home" and one "For Business" or maybe for simplicity just two sections on one page woth anchors, one pointing to the "For Home" section and one to the "For Business" section.
3. About Us
4. Why Us
5. Testimonials (this is not actually a page, it is a link to a partner site where the testimonials are published)
6. Prices
7. Contact Us. This page will have an address and a web form, no Google Maps. Same content as the Contact Us page on the BurnabyComputerRepair.com web site (it is my other web site). You do not need to do any coding or back end behind that form. I already have all necessary backend code fully operational. You just need to POST form data to the URL that I will provide. No fields validation is necessary. All validation is already done in my esisting backend. It is ok to set some max length of the fileds though in plain HTML code. Without any validation.

The yellow "Contact Us" buttons everywhere on the home page links to the "Contact Us" page.
The blue "Prices" buttons everywhere on the home page links to the "Prices" Page.

The site should work well for desktop browsers and on mobile devices. I can provide a template for the mobile version.

There are 4 identical sections on the home page with various ways to contact us.
When someone clicks on the "Call" link on a mobile device it should automatically call our number.
It might not work on desktop browsers because desktops very rarely have a voice calling app assigned to the "Tel/Call" links. So in the desktop version maybe it is best to just point to the ContactUs page?

WhatsApp link should make the mobile devise contact us via WhatsApp.
On the desktop it is still rare to have a desktop Whatsapp app installed so maybe best to also just have a link to the contact us page in the desktop browser version?

When "Text" link is pressed the mobile device should start a new SMS message to us.
Desktop version points to the ContactUs page.

Email link should always open the "Contact Us" page on the desktop and mobile version.

There are 4 QR codes at the bottom of the home page with images inside each QR code, resembling same icons as a Phone icon, WhatsApp logo, Text (SMS) icon and email envelope icon. Those QR codes (mine are just a template, i can generate real QR codes) point to the same links as the links described above.

I will provide better quality images for the red phone used on the page and "Consumer Choice Award" logo. I can also find a higher resolution Better Business Bureau logo.

Any questions? Feel free to ask!
